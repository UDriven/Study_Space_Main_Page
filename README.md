## About The Project

Udriven is an all-in-one productivity ecosystem designed for students and professionals who want to master their workflow. We're not just another to-do list; we're a complete environment built to manage your focus, tasks, and long-term goals.

This open-source project is built by a passionate team of students from **The Polaris Unofficial Tech Club** to create the ultimate tool for focused work and personal growth.

## ✨ Key Features

Udriven is built around several core modules that sync "interglobally" to create one seamless experience.

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🚀 Study Space** | A customizable, distraction-free environment with a smart Pomodoro timer, floating windows, integrated YouTube lectures, Spotify, and note-taking. |
| **🎯 To-Do Grid** | The ultimate "grind mode." A full-screen, deep-work session with *no breaks* allowed. Quitting a session is tracked to build accountability. |
| **📊 Dashboard** | Your central command center. See graphs from your Insights, upcoming events from your Calendar, and unfinished work from your Study Space all in one place. |
| **📈 Insights** | Visualize your productivity. Get detailed graphs and analytics on your work habits, session consistency, and task completion rates. |
| **🗓️ Calendars** | Manage your high-importance events, set countdowns for exams, and block out dedicated time for productive work. |
| **🎧 Music Zone (Heal)** | A dedicated space to disconnect and relax with soothing music and ambient sounds, separate from your work modules. |

## 🚀 Feature Spotlights (Animated)

### 1. The Ultimate Study Space

Forget juggling tabs. Our Study Space lets you build your perfect focus environment. Drag windows, embed your YouTube lecture, lock it in the background, and float your notes on top.

### 2. The Unbreakable To-Do Grid

When it's time for pure, uninterrupted work, enter the **To-Do Grid**. This locks you into your session. There are no breaks and no escape. If you quit, it's recorded. This is for serious accountability.
